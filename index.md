Hello and welcome!

I am Athena Zhang, a recent graduate from Northeastern University with high honors. I majored in Mathematics and Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing Analytics.

I am someone who thinks deeply and always chooses to take a step forward. I completed two co-ops, one at TJX focusing on store operations and analytics and another at Sephora focusing on merchandising. 
I also held two internships with Taco Bell Brand Marketing. You can learn more about my background on the [About](./about) page.

If you are curious about my work, the [Projects](./projects) page highlights projects related to merchandising and marketing analytics. 

You will also find some of my favorite photos in the [Gallery](./gallery).

Thank you for visiting. My resume, email, and social links are all in the sidebar, so feel free to connect with me :D
