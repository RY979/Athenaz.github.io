Hello and welcome!

I’m Athena Zhang, a recent graduate from Northeastern University with high honors. I majored in Mathematics and Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing Analytics.

I’m someone who thinks deeply and always chooses to take a step forward. I’ve completed two co-ops—one at TJX focusing on store operations and analytics and another at Sephora focused on merchandising. I also interned twice with Taco Bell Brand Marketing. You can learn more about my background on the [About](./about) page.

If you’re curious about my work, the [Projects](./projects) page highlights projects related to merchandising and marketing analytics. You’ll also find some of my favorite photos in the [Gallery](./gallery).

Thanks for stopping by. My resume email and social links are all in the sidebar so feel free to connect.
